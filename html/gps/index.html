Reflections:
What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? To give meaning to the HTML page. Also helpful when you go to style your page, you already have tags indicating layout ideas, and can select the tags for styling.
Which ones do you see as most useful? Nav, Aside, Main, Article, Header, Footer. (Most tags, I suppose.)
What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page? The browser's default is to display elements in the order they are declared.
What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Snippets! Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? Yes. It is very useful. We made a <li> snippet and I've already used it a few times.
What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept? I felt the challenge was pretty straight forward, but generally speaking, for concepts that I don't understand, I tend to do more research on them, practice using them, and in some cases, look for a good lynda.com or youtube tutorial.
