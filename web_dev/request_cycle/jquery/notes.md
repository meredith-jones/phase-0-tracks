## Plan for learning jquery:
* Find a couple good websites for learning
* Take 30 minutes to read or watch a tutorial, and try to implement something small.
* Continue watching or reading, 30 minutes at a time, while taking notes. Break when you can find something to implement.
* Can I possibly implement the jquery on my personal hiking website?
