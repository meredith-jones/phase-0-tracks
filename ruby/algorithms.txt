Write the algorithm for using an elevator:

-Determine which floor you need to go to.
-Determine which floor you are currently on.
    -Is your destination floor greater or lower in value than your current floor?
        -If greater, press the up arrow outside the elevator to indicate that you'd like to go up.
          -The button will light up when you press it successfully.
        -If lower, press the down arrow outside the elevator to indicate that you'd like to go down.
          -The button will light up when you press it successfully.
       -If your destination floor is the same as your current floor, you don't need to take the elevator, so you can leave the elevator area.

-When the elevator arrives, the button that you pressed will lose it's illumination, and that will indicate that you are to get on the next open elevator.
    -Look around to see which elevator is open.
    -If the arrow at the top of the elevator door corresponds with the arrow you pressed, and the doors are open, and people have finished exiting the elevator, you may now get on the elevator.

-Once inside the elevator, you check the wall near the door for a panel of buttons.
    -If the panel is not to the right of the door, check to the left of the door.

-Scan the buttons and press the button that corresponds with which floor you need to go to.
    -The button will light up when you have successfully pressed it.
    -If the button is already illuminated, someone has already pressed it, and you don't need to press it.

-The elevator will begin to move up or down.
    -Hold onto the closest side of the elevator so you don't fall.
    -If there is already a person or robot on the closest side, find the next closest side.

-There is a panel above the elevator door that indicates your current floor. Look at that panel.
    -When the current floor is equal to your destination floor, it is time to exit the elevator.

-To exit the elevator, head toward the door of the elevator.
    -When the door opens, proceed straight out of the elevator.

Come up with an example of a common task in your life that could be translated into an algorithm, and write out the steps in algorithms.txt (labeled with the name of the task).

Make a PB&J:

Search the kitchen for:
    -Bread
        -If you find bread:
            -Check the expiration date.
                -Make note of today's date.
                -If the expriation date is before today's date:
                    -Inspect the bread to determine if it is safe.
                        -If it looks, smells, and feels safe, you may continue making your sandwich.
                        -If it has mold on it, abort. Find something else to eat.
                -If the expriation date is after today's date:
                      -Proceed to looking for peanut butter.
            -If you don't find bread, abort. Find something else to eat.
    -Peanut Butter
        -If you find peanut butter:
            -Check the expiration date.
                -Make note of today's date.
                -If the expriation date is before today's date:
                    -Inspect the PB to determine if it is safe.
                        -If it looks, smells, and feels safe, you may continue making your sandwich.
                        -If it has mold in it, abort. Find something else to eat.
                -If the expriation date is after today's date:
                      -Proceed to looking for jelly.
        -If you don't find peanut butter, abort. Find something else to eat.
    -Jelly
        -If you find jelly:
            -Check the expiration date.
                -Make note of today's date.
                -If the expriation date is before today's date:
                    -Inspect the jelly to determine if it is safe.
                        -If it looks, smells, and feels safe, you may continue making your sandwich.
                        -If it has mold in it, abort. Find something else to eat.
                -If the expriation date is after today's date:
                      -Proceed to looking for a knife.
        -If you don't find jelly, look for honey.
        -If you don't find honey, look for bananas.
        -If you don't find bananas, find something else to eat.
    -A knife
      -If you find a knife:
          -Is it clean?
              -If yes, proceed to looking for a plate.
              -If no, wash the knife.
      -If you don't find a knife, look for a spoon.
    -A plate
      -If you find a plate:
          -Is it clean?
              -If yes, proceed to making sandwich.
              -If no, wash the plate.
      -If you don't find a plate, look for a paper towel.

Make the sandwich:
  -Open the bag containing the bread.
    -Take 2 pieces of bread from the bag.
    -Close the bag.
    -Place the pieces side by side on a plate.

  -Open the container of peanut butter.
    -With knife, gather peanut butter from container.
    -With knife, evenly distribute peanut butter across bread.
        -If there are any empty spots on bread with no peanut butter
            -If there is enough peanut butter to spread:
                -Continue to spread peanut butter around.
            -If there is not enough peanut butter to spread:
                -gather more peanut butter from contianer.
                -Add the gathered peanut butter to bread
                -Fill in gaps until evenly distributed.

  -Open the container of jelly.
    -With knife, gather jelly from container.
    -Identify the slice of bread that does not have peanut butter on it.
    -With knife, evenly distribute jelly across identified bread.
        -If there are any empty spots on bread with no jelly:
            -If there is enough jelly to spread:
                -Continue to spread jelly around.
            -If there is not enough jelly to spread:
                -Gather more jelly from contianer.
                -Add the gathered jelly to bread
                -Fill in gaps until evenly distributed.

  -Set down knife.
  -Pick up the piece of bread with jelly on it.
