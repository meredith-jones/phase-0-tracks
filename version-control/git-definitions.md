# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
  Version control is the means by which many people can contribute to a document in an organized manner. It involves making a copy of the original document, making changes, and then upon approval, merging the document with the original. It is useful because it allows multiple people to work on the same project at once.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
  A branch is the copy of the document you can work on before merging it back to the original. You use it when many people are working on one project, or when you are not sure about whether you want certain changes but want to test them out.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
  A commit is a way of saving the changes you made to your document onto your git repo. A good commit messages specifically states what changes were made, or what was done that that commit. It's also important to be specific in case you want to roll back changes--you'd want to know where to find them.
* What is a merge conflict?
  A merge conflict is a problem with the merge, I believe when 2 people submit 2 conflicting things.
